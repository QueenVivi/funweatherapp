# Fun Weather App
Fun Weather App is a responsive web application, that blended with emotional design and shows the weather result with different themes according to the weather condition.

The first iteration for this app has completed, and for the next iteration, itâ€™ll combine a travel API and show the recommended attractions of the searched place together with the weather result.

## Tech used
React.js, Typescript, Next.js, API integration, Tailwind, Responsive web development.

## Collabrations:
I woked closely with a product designer, who provided me with the high fidelity responsive design.

## Next steps and epic plans: 
- Integrate with travel API
